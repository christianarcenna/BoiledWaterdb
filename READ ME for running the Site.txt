How to run the Boiled Water DB.

Our Team used PostgreSQL with PG Admin 4
Python to populate Database, 
and php with Xampp to Pull and show results from database

First Step: Create a database called boiledwaterdb, and create the 5 tables.
	    In the folder this read me is in, in "SQL Captures" There is a txt file with all create table statements.

Second Step: Time to poulate the databases, run "boiledwaterdbpopulate.py" in template-py > db. Make sure your 
	     python has all the packages installed. Make sure the files username and passwords are correct
	     according to your database

	     This populate python file only populates until app_id reaches 500. Feel free to change the number 
	     for more data in the tables, keep in mind the bigger the number the more stable your connection
	     must be overtime. 3 times the number "500" will appear in the code, make sure you change all 3 to the
	     same number.

Third Step: Now time to run the site. Make sure you have Xampp installed and the files you will run is connected to
	    local host correctly. Feel free to move them to the correct folder to run. You will run "index.php"
	    in your browser to start. The .php files along with everythting conncected to them is located
	    in template-py > web > htdocs

And those are all the steps to get the site running :D Happy viewing!
